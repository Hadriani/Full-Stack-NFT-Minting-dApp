# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

This app was done to mint an NFT only once, that was deployed on Etherscan address, as mentioned here. So in order to use the minting process, my image was uploaded to thirdWeb to get the CID code from it (I didn't created the NFT on thirdWeb since I already had a smart contract here, used a random image and used it only for IPFS). Then, the NFT metadata I wrote was to create something new and to upgrade. On the home page, as you see inside the card, we have "Name" and "Description". The image link with CID from thirdWeb was written inside the code, then added the rest of the metadata to call the "name" and "description". On the page you need to write the name of your NFT, and the description for it. Once you press "Mint NFT" the metadata will be used for minting and deploy it on my smart contract address to Etherscan through Sepolia Testnet Network.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
